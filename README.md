# Challenge2

This is the read me for Challenge 2

I was given the task to do a portfolio for my future works in which we can work on through out the bootcamp.

As my background picture I used a picture that I personally took in my hometown Laredo, TX.

I added a "logo" part which is just my name with both of my favorite colors.

I also added a navigation bar, which I use youtube to learn how to code it. 

For challenge 2, my acceptance criteria was to create some internal and external links, but failed to do so as I could not figure out how internal links work within the navigation bar. 

I did not add anything in my previous work section, but will do as my portfolio grows bigger (and also i couldnt figure out how to add challenge 1 and display it in the html).

I added my contact info at the bottom of the page with external links which was easy to create/add
